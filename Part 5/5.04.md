Exercise 5.04 Comparison of commercial Kubernetes distributions
I decided to compare Google Anthos and VMware Tanzu. I arbitrarily decided VMware Tanzu is the "better" option.

Both over hybrid solutions, they allow deploying Kubernetes across on-premise, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.
VMware has extensive adoption and is trusted for on-premise hosting in both public institutions and also private companies. Last year VMware decided to make K8s an integral part of their offerings.
The hypervisor ESXi integrates K8s natively on the lowest level of infrastructure, whereas Anthos integrates itself as a VMware Appliance
Tanzu provides a service mesh built upon Istio and expands it across multiple clusters and clouds.
Tanzu provides its cloud native networking called "NSX" this provides firewalls, load balancing, and namespace isolation on the lowest level.
There might be the possibility of cost-saving if a company already has licenses from VMware
A aspect to take into consideration is that Tanzu is a newer solution than Anthos
