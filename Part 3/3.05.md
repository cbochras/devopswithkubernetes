Exercise 3.05: DBaaS pro/cons list
The following is a short pro and contra list that compares Database as a Service vs. self-configured and deployed database solutions. I have informed myself about the subject at DBaaS providers, in magazine articles and forums1, 2.

Pros for DBaaS:

Very easy to setup ➡️ no own know-how or personell necessary for the operation of the database server
scalability and elasticity
High Availability such as replications are provided
Easy backups (point in time recovery)
The billing is usage-based
Cons against DBaaS:

The billing is usage-based ➡️ Unpredictable costs can arise during peak loads
You need to trust the provider: Legal requirements may prohibit storing personal data on servers of third parties
Upgrades must be installed by the provider
No far-reaching changes to the server configuration are possible
